:warning: PSA: Tomorrow Wednesday March 6 between 9:30am and 11am CET (starting 12:30am in San Francisco, 3:30am in New York, 5:30pm in Tokyo), we will transfer the lampepfl/dotty repository to scala/scala3.

During that operation, the CI will not be operational. Any in-progress job will be canceled as we start the transfer. Please do not attempt to restart jobs. Avoid submitting PRs or pushing to branches with open PRs during the operation. Once the repo has been transferred and the CI is back online, existing PRs will need to be rebased on the latest main if they want a new CI run.

GitHub will automatically redirect HTTPS and git requests, so no immediate action will be required from your side for your links to keep working.

We will post a new message here when we start and finish.

Sorry for the disturbance, and thank you for your understanding.
